# Node.js Server with Robust Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple Node.js HTTP server and showcases improved error handling for situations such as port conflicts.  The `server.js` file contains the initial implementation with basic error handling, while `server-solution.js` provides a more robust solution.

## Problem

The initial implementation only handles the `EADDRINUSE` error (port already in use).  Other potential server errors are not gracefully managed, potentially leading to unexpected server behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The improved error handling in `server-solution.js` addresses this by providing more comprehensive error logging and feedback to the user.  It demonstrates techniques for better error reporting and recovery.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node server.js` or `node server-solution.js`. 
3. Observe the server's output and how errors are handled.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling for building reliable and maintainable Node.js applications.
